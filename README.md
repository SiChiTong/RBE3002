This project is an implementation of turtlebot autonomous navigation. The code uses Gmapping and AMCL to generate a map, and our custom code to autonomously map an enclosed space. An example of this code running can be found in [this video](https://youtu.be/-a9u7_Jrv0Y).

To run the code on the turtlebot, use roslaunch and run the following command:

    roslaunch rbe3002 turtlebot.launch

To run in the simulator, use roslaunch and and run the following command:

    roslaunch rbe3002 simulator.launch
